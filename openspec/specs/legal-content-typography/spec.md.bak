# legal-content-typography Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change style-legal-pages. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: H2 Heading Styling
The system SHALL render h2 elements using the --fs-h2 token for section headers with responsive sizing and spacing.

#### Scenario:
When a user views the privacy policy and sees a section header (e.g., "## How do we use your Personal Information?"), the h2 SHALL:
- Render at `--fs-h2` (clamp(24px, 3vw, 36px))
- Have `font-weight: 600` or `700`
- Have top margin of `var(--space-xl)` (breathing room before the section)
- Have bottom margin of `var(--space-md)` (separation from body text)
- Use `line-height: 1.4` for stable heading rendering
- Preserve `color: var(--color-text)` for brand consistency

### Requirement: H3 Heading Styling
The system SHALL render h3 elements using the --fs-h3 token for subsections with reduced prominence relative to h2.

#### Scenario:
A subsection header (e.g., "### What is Personal Information?") SHALL:
- Render at `--fs-h3` (clamp(20px, 2.5vw, 28px))
- Have `font-weight: 600`
- Have top margin of `var(--space-lg)` (slightly less than h2)
- Have bottom margin of `var(--space-sm)` (tighter spacing for subsections)
- Use `line-height: 1.4`

### Requirement: H4 Heading Styling
The system SHALL render h4 elements using the --fs-h4 token for minor subsection headers with further reduced prominence.

#### Scenario:
Minor headers (e.g., "#### Scenario:") SHALL:
- Render at `--fs-h4` (clamp(18px, 2vw, 24px))
- Have `font-weight: 600`
- Have top margin of `var(--space-md)`
- Have bottom margin of `var(--space-sm)`
- Use `line-height: 1.4`

### Requirement: Body Paragraph Styling
The system SHALL ensure readability for long-form legal text with appropriate line height and spacing.

#### Scenario:
Paragraphs in the privacy policy (e.g., "We understand and appreciate that you are concerned about privacy...") SHALL:
- Render at `--fs-body` (clamp(14px, 1.2vw, 16px))
- Have `line-height: 1.6` or `1.8` for comfortable reading
- Have `letter-spacing: normal` (no change)
- Have `margin-bottom: var(--space-md)` between paragraphs
- Preserve `color: var(--color-text)` (#111111)

### Requirement: Link Styling
The system SHALL style anchor elements with brand color and interactive feedback.

#### Scenario:
When a link appears in legal content (e.g., "[www.oceanfoodgroup.com.au](http://www.oceanfoodgroup.com.au)"), it SHALL:
- Be styled with `color: var(--color-primary)` (#111827)
- Have `text-decoration: underline`
- Have `text-decoration-offset: 2px` for visual separation
- Change to `opacity: 0.8` on `:hover`
- Change to `opacity: 0.6` on `:active`
- Have `transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out` for smooth feedback
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA)

### Requirement: Unordered List Styling
The system SHALL style bullet lists with proper indentation and spacing for legal content.

#### Scenario:
An unordered list in the privacy policy (e.g., collection methods) SHALL:
- Render with default bullet points (`list-style: disc`)
- Have `margin-left: 1.5em` or equivalent padding for clear indentation
- Have list items with `line-height: 1.6`
- Have `margin-bottom: 0.5em` between list items (tighter than paragraphs)
- Have `margin-bottom: var(--space-md)` after the entire list for separation from following content

### Requirement: Ordered List Styling
The system SHALL style numbered lists with proper indentation and spacing.

#### Scenario:
An ordered list (e.g., allergen disclaimers with numbered points) SHALL:
- Render with default decimal numbering (`list-style: decimal`)
- Have same indentation, spacing, and line-height as unordered lists
- Support nested lists (e.g., subsections under a numbered item) with appropriate visual nesting

### Requirement: Strong Emphasis Styling
The system SHALL ensure `<strong>` elements stand out from body text.

#### Scenario:
When legal text uses **strong** emphasis (e.g., "**You consent to**"), it SHALL:
- Have `font-weight: 700`
- Use the same color and size as surrounding text
- Provide visual distinction through weight alone

### Requirement: Emphasis Styling
The system SHALL ensure `<em>` elements are distinct without being distracting.

#### Scenario:
When text uses *italic* emphasis (e.g., "_Your consent_"), it SHALL:
- Have `font-style: italic`
- Use the same color and weight as surrounding text
- Provide visual distinction through style alone

### Requirement: Container Max-Width
The system SHALL constrain legal content to optimal reading line length.

#### Scenario:
The prose container SHALL:
- Have `max-width: 65ch` or similar (Tailwind: `max-w-prose`)
- Center horizontally within the page via `margin: 0 auto`
- Preserve responsive padding via existing page component styles
