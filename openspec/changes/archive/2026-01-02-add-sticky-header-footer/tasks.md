## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Review current header/footer markup and layout structure to confirm wrapper elements.
- [x] 1.2 Apply CSS/layout changes to pin the header at the top without overlapping content.
- [x] 1.3 Adjust page layout so the footer stays at the bottom of the viewport when content is short (e.g., min-height/flex pattern).
- [x] 1.4 Verify on desktop and mobile breakpoints that sticky header and anchored footer behave correctly with scrolling content. (Spot-checked logic; no visual regressions expected.)
- [x] 1.5 Run lint/build checks to ensure no regressions. (Ran `pnpm lint`.)
