## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Three Component Variants

- The Card Grid component SHALL support exactly four distinct variants that provide different visual presentations or behaviors: Feature (icon with bullet points), Image (image with title and text), Expandable (interactive folded/unfolded states), and Centered (centered vertical layout).
- Feature variant SHALL include an optional icon (80px size at 1920px baseline, default icon used if not provided) above a left-aligned title (font size `var(--fs-h4)`), with bullet point text below (font size `var(--fs-body-lg)`), baseline dimensions of 442px × 456px when displaying 3 cards (aspect ratio ≈ 0.97:1) or 324px × 452px when displaying 4 cards (aspect ratio ≈ 0.72:1) at 1920px screen width with proportional scaling at other screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratios, on mobile screens (<768px) SHALL use horizontal scrolling container with `bg-3card.png` background for all cards showing 1 full card + ~50% of next card by default with scrollable access to all cards, border radius of `var(--radius-lg)`, default background image of `public/images/components/card-grid/v1/bg-3card.png` when displaying 3 cards or `public/images/components/card-grid/v1/bg-4card.png` when displaying 4 cards on desktop/tablet, and hover effects changing background to primary color with upward movement.
- Image variant SHALL include an image at the top, title below the image (single line), and text below the title (single line), with baseline dimensions of 318px × 388px (aspect ratio ≈ 0.82:1) at 1920px screen width with proportional scaling at other screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratio, gap of `var(--space-md)` between image and title, image border radius of `var(--radius-lg)`, and SHALL display exactly 2 cards per row on mobile screens (<768px).
- Expandable variant SHALL include interactive folded/unfolded states with hover effects (desktop/tablet) or click/tap interactions (mobile), displaying background image, optional icon (default icon used if not provided), and title when folded (442px × 456px dimensions with 0.97:1 aspect ratio when displaying 3 cards, or 324px × 452px dimensions with 0.72:1 aspect ratio when displaying 4 cards at 1920px baseline), and expanding to 2x width when unfolded (884px × 456px dimensions with 1.94:1 aspect ratio when displaying 3 cards, or 648px × 452px dimensions with 1.43:1 aspect ratio when displaying 4 cards at 1920px baseline) showing title and text content (12 lines max) with typography matching other variants, border radius of `var(--radius-lg)` for both folded and unfolded states, default background images `bg-{n}-3cards.png` for folded state and `bg-{n}-3cards-expanded.png` for unfolded state from `public/images/components/card-grid/v3/` where {n} is the card position (1-3) when displaying 3 cards, or `bg-{n}-4cards.png` for folded state and `bg-{n}-4cards-expanded.png` for unfolded state from `public/images/components/card-grid/v3/` where {n} is the card position (1-4) when displaying 4 cards. There SHALL ALWAYS be exactly one unfolded card and the rest folded - by default the first card is unfolded, and interacting with any card SHALL unfold it while folding the currently unfolded card.
- Centered variant SHALL include a centered vertical layout with optional icon (max width 150px at 1920px baseline, cycles through default icons 1.svg, 2.svg, 3.svg, 4.svg from /public/images/components/card-grid/v4/ if not provided) at the top, center-aligned title below, and justified text below the title, using the same typography as other variants, border radius of `var(--radius-lg)`, and baseline dimensions of 442px × 456px (aspect ratio ≈ 0.97:1) when displaying 3 cards or 324px × 452px (aspect ratio ≈ 0.72:1) when displaying 4 cards at 1920px screen width with proportional scaling at other screen sizes while maintaining aspect ratios, on mobile screens (<768px) SHALL display cards in a left-right layout with icon on the left side and title/text content on the right side using flex-row layout, 64px × 64px icon size, 16px vertical padding and 24px horizontal padding, background image `public/images/components/card-grid/v4/bg-card-mb.png` (670×251px), and on desktop screens (≥768px) SHALL maintain the centered vertical layout with 36px vertical padding and 32px horizontal padding.

#### Scenario: Centered Mobile Layout

- **GIVEN** the Card Grid component uses "centered" variant
- **WHEN** rendered on mobile screens (< 768px)
- **THEN** each card uses a horizontal flex layout with icon on the left
- **AND** title and justified text appear on the right side, stacked vertically
- **AND** the card has 16px vertical padding and 24px horizontal padding
- **AND** the icon has dimensions of 64px × 64px
- **AND** the card uses background image `public/images/components/card-grid/v4/bg-card-mb.png`
